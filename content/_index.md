# About Me

👋 Hi there! I'm **Ivan Simantiev**, a passionate **Tech Lead**, **Python developer**, and **educator** based in **Odesa**. 🐍🚀

💻 With over **6 years of experience** in Python development, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, honing my skills and diving deep into the world of code.

🎓 In addition to my development role, I have been teaching for **3.5 years**, sharing my knowledge and expertise with over **400 enthusiastic students**. Being an educator allows me to inspire and empower others to embrace the wonders of programming.

🌟 My main interests lie in **Python** and **DevOps**. I love turning infrastructure into code—because who doesn’t enjoy making servers behave with a few lines of YAML? I'm always eager to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in these fields.

🌍 Let's connect and embark on an exciting journey together in the realms of Python and DevOps! Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, project ideas, or just want to geek out about coding. 🤓🌱
