Financyka is an Open-Source Telegram bot. The main idea is to help organize income and expenses.
It uses spacy NER models to parse operations and classify categories of transactions.

Currently, it supports a fixed categories list, but in the future count will grow.
Also, it supports only one language, feel free to add more languages by sending PR to [the project repository](https://github.com/iYasha/financyka-bot).
